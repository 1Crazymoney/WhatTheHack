[Back](challenge05.md) - [Home](../readme.md) - [Next](challenge07.md)

### Introduction

In this challenge we will build on what we did in the previous challenges by enabling another day 2 operational senario. The day 2 senario we will enable in this challenge is going to be Azure Policy. We will enable Azure Policy on both the deployed clusters.

### Challenge

1. Enable Azure Policy add-on within both the Arc enabled clusters.
2. Discuss and understand the technologies involved in enable this feature.
3. Apply Azure Policies to ensure all Arc for Kubernetes resources comply with the following:
   * Deploy GitOps to Kubernetes cluster
   * Ensure container CPU and memory resource limits do not exceed the specified limits in Kubernetes cluster
   * Enforce labels on pods in Kubernetes cluster
4. Discuss how to create a custom policy and apply it across all the Arc enabled Kubernetes clusters.

### Success Criteria

This challenge will be complete when Azure Policy functionality is enabled on all deployed clusters and a general understanding of the technologies involved in enabling it are had.
