# Challenge 1: Deploy IoTHub/Edge

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Pre-requisites 

- An Azure IoT Hub created in **one of the regions where Device Streams are available**. At the time of writing, these are: Central US, Central US EUAP (Early Updates Access Program), North Europe, and Southeast Asia. Check the updated list here [Device Streams: Regional availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-streams-overview#regional-availability).

## Introduction
 This is the first step of getting an environment setup to work from. This will be a straightforward challenge to ensure you have your subscription setup and to devise a plan to work with your team if you're working as part of a group.  This will be used to work as the starting point for IoT Edge communication in subsequent modules. 


## Success Criteria
1. IoT Hub created
1. IoT Edge Device Endpoint created in the hub
1. Ability to show what the device connection string is
1. Provisioning a 'virtual' IoT Edge Device
