# Challenge 3: Get Some Data

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

All app development work in Azure should have Application Insights turned on and used by default. This invaluable tool can be used for standard and custom telemetry and much more.

## Description

- In your shell, create a CosmosDB Account 
  - **NOTE:** When creating large resources, be patient for it to end.
- Copy the `PrimaryMasterKey` of the CosmosDB Account you just created as we will be needing it later
- **TIP:** Once again, think about using a shell variable to hold this value.

## Success Criteria

1. You've successfully created a new CosmosDB.
2. You've saved off the `PrimaryMasterKey` in a variable for future use.
