## Notes and Tips
1. Embed the Bot into a Web Page. The specific guidance has been provided in the student guide. Some advanced students may create a more creative or elegant solution. As long as a student shows a function Bot on a web page, it is a pass.
2. You can follow the exact [step by step guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-directlinespeech?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) to create a Direct Line Speech Channel to your bot. 
3. Then, scroll down the guidance, you will find the Example session where you can find the ['Voice-enable your bot using the Speech SDK'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) link.
4. Following that link, you can jump directly to the ['Run the Windows Voice Assistant Client'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk#run-the-windows-voice-assistant-client) section.
5. If the student chooses the optional challenge and creates Voice-Enabled Web Chat. The major challenge here is how they handle the authentication method. The best practice is to use the authorization token. And, the easiest way to demonstrate that is to use Postman to generate the token. In production, people will create a function for token generation.
