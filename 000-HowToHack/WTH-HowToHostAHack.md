# How to Host a What The Hack

We've structured the What The Hack format to make it easy to deliver to students both in person and virtually. The following are instructions, tips and tricks to hosting your own What The Hack and have it go off without a hitch.

This document has the following sections:
- [WTH Event Requirements](#what-do-you-need-to-host-a-what-the-hack-event)
- [WTH Event Preparation](#event-preparation)
- [WTH Event Day](#event-day)
- [In-Person Event Tips](#tips-for-in-person)
- [Virtual Event Tips](#tips-for-virtual)

## What do you need to host a What The Hack event?

At minimum, three things:
1. [Hack Content](#hack-content)
1. [Microsoft Teams](#microsoft-teams)
1. [People](#people)

### Hack Content

First and most important is hack content! The What The Hack collection has many different hackathons that have been contributed. 

Choose a hack from the [What The Hack Collection](../readme.md#what-the-hack-collection)

Or, create your own with the guidance we have on [How To Author A What The Hack](WTH-HowToAuthorAHack.md)

### Microsoft Teams

Next, you need Microsoft Teams! Specifically, you will need to create a team in Microsoft Teams for your event that the attendees will collaborate in.

**Note:** While you could host a WTH event using other collaboration tools, we strongly recommend using Microsoft Teams. When we stay "strongly recommend", it means we are writing this document based on using Teams. ;)

During a WTH event, attendees work together in squads* of 3 to 5 people to solve the hack's challenges. The attendees will need to share links, code snippets, or even screen share as they collaborate on the challenge solutions. Microsoft Teams makes this easy to do by having each squad assigned a Channel to work in. 

At an in-person event, each squad will be sitting at the same table. During a virtual event, everyone will be sitting at home in their pajamas. The main difference is that during a virtual event, attendees will need to join a call in their squad's channel for the duration of the event. Most other aspects of the event are the same!

**Note:** Why are the groups of 3 to 5 attendees working together called "squads"? It is natural to call them "teams" or "hack teams". However, the word "teams" is overloaded when we talk about "Microsoft Teams" (the app) and the "team" within the app that is created for the event! So, "squads" it is!

**Note:** With the Covid-19 pandemic, virtual events will be the way of the future for some time. If you are working from home, take advantage of this time to sharpen your skills by hosting or participating in a virtual WTH event!

### People 

Finally, you need people to hack! There are a few different roles that will need to be played at your What The Hack event. They include:
- Lead Coach
	- The lead of the event both logistically and technically. 
	- Responsible for the event preparation steps [outlined below](#event-preparation).
	- This person should be intimately familiar with the content and all of its solutions.
	- Delivers kick off meeting & challenge intro lecture presentations (if required)
- Coaches
	- The lead of a squad of 3 to 5 attendees.
	- Recommended to have 1 coach per every 5 attendees. At minimum, need 1 coach per every 10 attendees
	- Provides guidance and direction for the squad but does **NOT** provide answers.
	- In charge of determining whether a squad has finished a challenge and should move to the next one.
- Attendees
	- The students in the event that participate in squads of 3 to 5.
	- Must join and participate in their squad's Teams channel

## Event Preparation

Will your event be in-person or virtual? It doesn't matter.  Most of the preparation steps are the same. It starts out by knowing your audience!

### Know your Audience
- Internal to your organization?
- External (single organization)
- External (many organizations)
- Licensing concerns
- Audio conferencing
- Privacy Concerns
- Azure subscription?  
	- Predicted resource consumption
- Security concerns?  Admin access on attendee workstations?
### MS Team Creation
- General Channel
- Coaches Channel (Private)
- Feedback Channel
- Squad Channels
- Pre-load hack content
	- Pin challenges tab
	- Channel Creation
	- Event kick off PPT template
	- Downgit Student resources into Files tab

### Getting People To Your Event

- Registration and invites
	- Advertise your hack!
	- Registration
	- Use Microsoft Forms and Flow
- Calendar Blocks! (especially for a virtual event!)
	- Link to the General Channel
	- Include a "join code" if internal audience

## Event Day 
(Running your WTH Event)

- Use the Event KickOff presentation to cover logistics
- In-Person
	- Attendees join team via join code
- Virtual
	- Attendees join via the "Meet Now" meeting in the General Channel
- Lead Coach covers logistics
- Forming Squads
	- Load balanced by skill level
	- Segregated by skill level
	- Up to event organizers
	- Virtual: Squads by TimeZone
### Hacking
- In-Person
	- Tables work together
	- Screenshare via squad channels
- Virtual
	- "Meet Now" in squad channels
	- Use channel for chat & screensharing

#### Coach Responsibilities

- Keep the teams working as teams!
    - Encourage all to “learn from” and “share with” each other!
    - If you observe individuals racing ahead, encourage them to help those who are behind.
    - Encourage attendees to use their team’s channel on MS Teams to collaborate/share info! 
- Unblock teams who get stuck 
    - Encourage team members to unblock each other first!
    - Provide hints, but not answers
    - If you observe individuals stuck for a while, help them get moving so they don’t lose interest.
- Provide hints/pointers to the teams on how to solve problems & where to find information.
    - Use the answers/solutions in the proctor’s guide, but don’t share with the attendees
    - Proctor’s guide won’t be comprehensive.  As SMEs, proctors should use their knowledge to help with solution hints/ideas.  
- Notify the emcee of unexpected blockers that arise during the event so they can be communicated to all, and recorded for future reference.

- **GF NOTE** `I want to remove this bullet, there is to be no guidance on post challenge stuff, if anything we should discourage it. Remember 'do not be beholden to the clock'? We have to account for slow tables vs. fast tables`
  - Review of each challenge’s solution to be presented after challenge completion


#### Hack Attendee - Responsibilities

- Learn
- Do
- Learn
- Share!

**NOTE:** Attendees should not be judged on how far they get.  No trophies should be given for challenge completion.  If event hosts want to gamify/incentivize attendees, they should focus on encouraging attendees to share with each other!

# Event Kick Off Presentation
You can find a Powerpoint presentation template you can use to kick off your What The Hack.

In it we have put most of the instructions above in a form that you can present to the attendees before starting the What The Hack.
