# What is What The Hack?

"What the Hack" is a set of challenge based hackathons that can be hosted in-person or virtually via Microsoft Teams.

Attendees work in squads of 3 to 5 people to solve a series of technical challenges for a given technology or solution scenario. Challenges describe high-level tasks and goals to be accomplished. Challenges are not step-by-step labs.

What The Hack is designed to be a collaborative learning experience.  Attendees "learn from" and "share with" each other. Without step-by-step instructions given for the challenges, attendees have to "figure it out" together as a team.  This results in greater knowledge retention for the attendees. 

The attendee squads are not alone in solving the challenges. Coaches work with each squad to provide guidance for, but not answers to, the challenges.  The coaches may also provide lectures and demos to introduce the challenges, as well as review challenge solutions throughout the event.

# How to Host a What The Hack!

Would you like to host a What The Hack for your organization? The WTH format and content has been designed for hosting a hack with groups of 5 to 50 people. We welcome anyone to use the content here to host their own WTH event!

See our complete guide to hosting a hack in the "000-HowToHack" folder.

**GF: SHOULD WE REMOVE THIS UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CALENDAR OF EVENTS?** *-- Alternatively, you may request folks at Microsoft to host or deliver one to your organization.  You can also see a list of existing WTH events and register to attend one in a city near you! Check out our "WTH Events" list.*

# How to Create and Contribute a new What The Hack!

Would you like to create a new What The Hack?  We welcome all new hacks!  We have developed a process for doing this.  This includes a set of guidelines and templates to help you package your hack up for the What The Hack repo!

Hacks can focus on a single technology or focus on a solution scenario that features multiple technologies working  together to solve a business problem.

See our complete guide to creating a hack in the ["000-HowToHack"](/000-HowToHack) folder.
