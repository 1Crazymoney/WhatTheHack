# How to Host a What The Hack

We've structured the What The Hack format to make it easy to deliver to students both in person and remotely. The following are instructions, tips and tricks to hosting your own What The Hack and have it go off without a hitch.

This document has the following sections:
- [WTH Event Requirements](#what-do-you-need-to-host-a-what-the-hack-event)
- [WTH Event Preparation](#event-preparation)
- [WTH Event Day](#event-day)
- [In-Person Event Tips](#tips-for-in-person)
- [Virtual Event Tips](#tips-for-virtual)

## What do you need to host a What The Hack event?

At minimum, three things:
- [Hack Content](#hack-content)
- [People](#people)
- [Microsoft Teams](#microsoft-teams)

### Hack Content

First and most important is hack content! The What The Hack repo has many different hackathons that have been contributed. 

Choose a hack from the [What The Hack Collection](../readme.md#what-the-hack-collection)

Or, create your own with the guidance we have on [How To Author A What The Hack](WTH-HowToAuthorAHack.md)

### People 

You need people to hack! There are a few different roles that will need to be played at your What The Hack event. They include:
- Lead Coach
	- The lead of the event both logistically and technically. 
	- Should be intimately familiar with the content and all its solutions.
	- In charge setting up Teams and channels to support the event.
	- Delivers challenge intro presentations (if required)
- Coaches
	- The lead of a squad of 3 to 5 attendees.
	- Provides guidance and direction for the squad but does **NOT** provide answers.
	- In charge of determining whether a squad has finished a challenge and should move to the next one.
- Attendees
	- The students in the event that participate in squads of 3 to 5.
	- Must join and participate in their squad's Teams channel (both local and remote What The Hacks will have Teams channels created for the squad).

### MS Teams
- Hack designed for in-person & virtual. 
- We make heavy use of Microsoft Teams
- Preparing for in-person or virtual is mostly the same.  We'll call out differences later.

## Event Preparation
	
- In-Person or Virtual?
- Registration & Invites
### Know your Audience
- Internal to your organization?
- External (single organization)
- External (many organizations)
- Licensing concerns

- Privacy Concerns
- Azure subscription?  
	- Predicted resource consumption
- Security concerns?  Admin access on attendee workstations?
### MS Team Creation
- General Channel
- Coaches Channel (Private)
- Feedback Channel
- Squad Channels
- Pre-load hack content
	- Pin challenges tab
	- Channel Creation
	- Event kick off PPT template
	- Downgit Student resources into Files tab

## Event Day 
(Running your WTH Event)
	
### Kick-Off Meeting 
- Use the Event KickOff presentation to cover logistics
- In-Person
	- Attendees join team via join code
- Virtual
	- Attendees join via the "Meet Now" meeting in the General Channel
- Lead Coach covers logistics
- Forming Squads
	- Load balanced by skill level
	- Segregated by skill level
	- Up to event organizers
	- Virtual: Squads by TimeZone
### Hacking
- In-Person
	- Tables work together
	- Screenshare via squad channels
- Virtual
	- "Meet Now" in squad channels
	- Use channel for chat & screensharing

#### Coach Responsibilities

- Keep the teams working as teams!
    - Encourage all to “learn from” and “share with” each other!
    - If you observe individuals racing ahead, encourage them to help those who are behind.
    - Encourage attendees to use their team’s channel on MS Teams to collaborate/share info! 
- Unblock teams who get stuck 
    - Encourage team members to unblock each other first!
    - Provide hints, but not answers
    - If you observe individuals stuck for a while, help them get moving so they don’t lose interest.
- Provide hints/pointers to the teams on how to solve problems & where to find information.
    - Use the answers/solutions in the proctor’s guide, but don’t share with the attendees
    - Proctor’s guide won’t be comprehensive.  As SMEs, proctors should use their knowledge to help with solution hints/ideas.  
- Notify the emcee of unexpected blockers that arise during the event so they can be communicated to all, and recorded for future reference.

- **GF NOTE** `I want to remove this bullet, there is to be no guidance on post challenge stuff, if anything we should discourage it. Remember 'do not be beholden to the clock'? We have to account for slow tables vs. fast tables`
  - Review of each challenge’s solution to be presented after challenge completion


#### Hack Attendee - Responsibilities

- Learn
- Do
- Learn
- Share!

**NOTE:** Attendees should not be judged on how far they get.  No trophies should be given for challenge completion.  If event hosts want to gamify/incentivize attendees, they should focus on encouraging attendees to share with each other!

### Stand-Ups/Check-ins

# Event Kick Off Presentation
You can find a Powerpoint presentation template you can use to kick off your What The Hack.

In it we have put most of the instructions above in a form that you can present to the attendees before starting the What The Hack.
