[Back](challenge04.md) - [Home](../../readme.md) - [Next](challenge06.md)

### Introduction

1. [What is Continuous Delivery?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-continuous-delivery)

### Challenge

1. Create a new Release Pipeline using the Azure App Service Deployment Template
2. To start off our deployment will only have one stage, lets call it `Integration`
3. The output of our CI Build pipeline will be the input artifact to our CD Release pipeline, add it. 
4. Enable Continous deployment so that each time the CI pipeline finishes successfully, this pipeline will start. 
5. If you look at the tasks for our `Integration` stage you will see a single `Deploy Azure App Service` task, however before we do this, we will need to create our environment using the same Infrastructure as Code technique we used in the last challenge. In our ArmTemplates folder you will find an templated called `container-webapp-template.json`. Examine this file in VS Code. What does it do? What parameters does the template expect?
6. Add a **Azure Resource Group Deployment** task as the first step in your pipeline to execute this ARM template and configure its properties, the same way you did in the last challenge.
   1. NOTE: your webapp name needs to be globally unique, add `-ingergration` to the end.
   2. HINT: your container registry name should be fully qualified (i.e. something.azurecr.io)


### Success Criteria

1. You should now be able to manually trigger a successful release.
2. Make a small change to your code (for example: update some fo the HTML on the Index page `/Application/aspnet-core-dotnet-core/Views/Home/Index.cshtml`), it should automatically trigger a build and release.
3. View the website running in your intergration environment.
