Hello!

Thanks for registering for the "What The Hack: IoT Hack of The Century" event on May 5th - May 7th!

Format stuff here...

We will be hosting the event in Microsoft Teams in a team created for this event. This will not be your normal Teams meeting! Your first "challenge" will be to add yourself to the event team.

The team's name is **"WTH - IoT Hack of the Century (May 2020)"**

1.) Open Microsoft Teams and join the Team for this event by using the following join code: 

**YOUR-CODE-GOES-HERE**

We will kick-off by meeting **in the General channel** of this team at 10am Eastern on Wednesday the 22nd!!!

2.) Click this link to go to the General Channel:
**Insert link to General Channel Here**

When you arrive, you should see a purple **"Join"** button to join the meeting.

**NOTE:** If the link above doesn't work for you, it means you haven't been added to the Team or are attending as a guest from a different organization. Please contact the event organizer, provide your e-mail address, and request that they add you to the team.

Although this event is virtual, you will be expected to be available for full participation with your teammates throughout the duration of the event.

This placeholder has blocked your calendar. Now, it's up to YOU to arrange coverage of your business while you are participating in the hack. Thanks for registering and treat this hackathon as an opportunity to invest in your technical intensity!

If you have any questions or need to cancel your registration, please email the event organizer (organizer@event)

Thanks,
