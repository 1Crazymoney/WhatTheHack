# Getting everything working locally

This will download and run everything locally.
The only thing you require is docker.

1. Download the code [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/alihhussain/WhatTheHack/tree/master/014-OSS%20DevOps/Host/Solutions/challenge09)

## Running it locally

```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Cleaning up

Don't forget to shut the demo down, once finished:

```shell
$ docker-compose down -v
```
