# Event-driven FHIR Patient Search

# Introduction
Welcome to the coach's guide for the Event-driven FHIR Patient Search What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

Also remember that this hack includes a optional [lecture presentation](Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.
