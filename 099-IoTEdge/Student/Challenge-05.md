# Challenge 5: Process Steaming Data 

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-06.md)

## Introduction

Now that we have data streaming into Azure and we are able to gather general insights about the data coming from our Industrial IoT environment it is important to be able to analyze real-time telemetry streams, perform geospatial analysis, and perform advanced anomaly detection. Cmplex event-processing engines are designed to analyze high volumes of fast streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously. At times these run in the cloud but they can also run at the edge.

Stream processing is useful in a number of scenarios including:

  - triggering actions and initiating workflows such as creating alerts, feeding information to a reporting tool, or storing transformed data in a data lake for later use
  - reducing the amount of data sent to the cloud for bandwidth constrained scenarios
  - low latency filtering, aggregation or anomaly detection at the edge
