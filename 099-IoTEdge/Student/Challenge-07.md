# Challenge 7: Connect to Devices with Device Streams

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-06.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Pre-requisites

For this challenge you will need the following:

- A `SSH` client installed. On Windows, this is available out-of-the-box in recent builds of Windows 10 and in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (both 1 and 2). You can also download a simple client if needed, such as [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/). It should also be available out-of-the-box in most Linux distributions and MacOS.

- An Azure IoT Hub created in one of the regions where Device Streams are available. At the time of writing, these are: Central US, Central US EUAP (Early Updates Access Program), North Europe, and Southeast Asia. Check the updated list here [Device Streams: Regional availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-streams-overview#regional-availability).

- A device or VM running IoT Edge that can be SSH'd into.

- **visual studio/code?????**

## Introduction

When you get to this challenge, you'll have used several of the core capabilties of Azure IoT and Azure IoT Edge, as well as some of the ecosystem services what are frequently used together, such as Azure Stream Analytics or Timeseries Insights. If you have done IoT before, you'll know that Device Monitoring and Diagnosing problems are high on the list of requirements.

The goal of this challenge is to experiment with a simple and secure way of connecting remotely to IoT Edge devices to check on their status, using one of the preview capabilities of Azure IoT Hub: **Device Streams**.
