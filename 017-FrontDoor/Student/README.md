# Welcome to Contoso Masks!

## Introduction

Contoso Masks is a fictitious local company that for years has made fun facial masks for either medical professionals or for people that spend a lot of time visiting loved ones in a care facility.  Recent events have made them ***super*** popular on the Internet, where every one in the world wants a MineCraft mask or one of the other designs!

We are going to go on a journey together to help the Contoso Mask web site grow up very quickly using the Front Door Service.
