# What The Hack - Microservices in Azure
## Introduction
The Microservices in Azure hack is intended to teach how to host, operate, and monitor Azure workloads running microservices. During this hack you will be working in Azure App Services, Container Instances, CosmosDB, and Application Insights.

This hack includes a [lecture slide deck](Coach/Lectures.pptx) that features short presentations to introduce key topics associated with each challenge. It is recommended that the host present each short presentation before attendees kick off that challenge.
